# 8pots1mux
Here's a super-basic PCB designed to use a CD4051 multiplexor IC to send 8 pot values to your microcontroller (or whatever) of choice!  I've been using them in Daisy Seed and Rasperry Pi Pico projects, they're fun!

Required components (plus Tayda or Mouser links, current as of 2023/08/09):  

- 8x [9mm vertical potentiomenters 100k linear taper](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/100k-ohm-linear-taper-potentiometer-round-knurled-plastic-shaft-pcb-9mm.html)-- like the stuff used in Eurorack!  
- 1x [10nF 0805 capacitor  ](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/10nf-50v-smd-ceramic-chip-capacitor.html)  
- 1x [CD4051 SOIC-Narrow-16 IC](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Texas-Instruments/CD4051BM96?qs=0le1rQK8zxqMHlJa1GNAzQ%3D%3D)    
- 1x 6 pin 2.54mm spaced connector of your choice ([maybe something like this](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/6-pin-2-54mm-single-row-female-pin-header.html)).
